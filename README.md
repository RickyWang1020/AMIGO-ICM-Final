<h2>Abstract</h2>

In  this  work,  we  designed  and  implemented AMIGO, a  frame-work that can generate accompaniment and instrumenta-tion based on a single melody.  Our key contribution is tobridge the gap between accompaniment and instrumenta-tion through rule-based algorithms.  Through uploading asingle track midi file of melody and selecting parametersof interest on a web interface,  our system can return theuser with a playable, fully accompanied and instrumentedaudio file.  Preliminary experiments showed this approachdoes produce harmonious accompaniment and instrumen-tation for simple melodies.

<h2>Running AMIGO</h2>

To run `AMIGO`, simply execute
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
